# inf1005-3
Repository for replication materials for data visualisation assignment. Created for the course INF1005H Open Data Private Data (2020) at the Faculty of Information, University of Toronto, Winter 2020

This was an exercise in data visualisation for the Open Data cource taught by Professor Seamus Ross in the Faculty of Information, and submitted as part of a Master of Information degree.

The exercise is derived from an activity created by Professor Mike Smit, School of Information Management at Dalhousie University, and described by him at http://open.canada.ca/en/blog/teaching-open-data.

This exercise is a data retreaval and visualisation exercise, not a formal research project. It is not intended to suggest any conclusions about the data.

Further information about the assignment.

(a) from your examinations of Federal and Municipal Open Data Portals select a dataset or mutiple datasets (You might use those that you are working with for your final project) which would help you to answer a question which you think might be interesting. (If you want you can use Provincial Open Data Resources.)

(b) “Collectively, the dataset(s) you choose must be non-trivial. A trivial data set would be one where I could analyze and visualize it in my head. You will be looking for non-obvious information from the data. For example, the number of people expelled from the country by the Canada Border Services Agency (per region) is trivial. But if you combine that data with demographic data and crime statistics to tell me something interesting, collectively your data is non-trivial. Of course you can also choose a single data set that is itself non-trivial! Examine your data using any mix of techniques (the use of multiple visualizations is encouraged). Report something interesting about the data, and present your data (and your interesting point) visually” (Smit, 2014).

(c) Prepare two Powerpoint slides (plus a cover slide with your name, student number, course details, and assignment number) to enable you to deliver a 2 minute presentation in class. One slide should include the citation to the dataset, and the other slide the visualization. In your two minute presentation you should describe the question you asked, why you thought the dataset would help you answer it, what how discovered, and how the visualization makes your finding transparent.

(d) PDF your Powerpoint presentation along with a brief statemnts (roughly 250 words) outlining of the question, why you asked it, what you discovered and how the visualization makes your finding transparent, and submit.
